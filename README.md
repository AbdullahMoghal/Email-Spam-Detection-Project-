# Email Spam Detection Project

## Overview

This project is a tutorial practice project based on a YouTube tutorial by “DSwithBappy”. It focuses on building a machine-learning model to detect spam emails. The project demonstrates how to use various machine-learning algorithms to classify emails as either "spam" or "ham" (not spam). The primary objective is to help users understand the process of developing a spam detection model from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

## Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: Includes steps like tokenization, removal of stopwords, and text vectorization to prepare the data for machine learning.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Implementation of different algorithms for spam detection, such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Decision Trees.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessment of the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Data Visualization**: Visual representation of data distributions and model performance using `matplotlib`.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
